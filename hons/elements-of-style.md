# How to write a good great

## Paragraphs

* A paragraph should contain a single idea, length is less of a factor than context

* A paragraph should be started with a leading sentence that provides context to the coming prose. 

* If the paragraph is part of a longer series of ideas, then it should also link to the previous one. 

## Voice

The active voice (I) is much better than the passive (my). By using the active voice, sentences are made stronger and shorted. 

Passive
> "There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground" 

Active
> "Dead leaves covered the ground" 

## Positive Form

Assertions should be definite, for example;

Noncommittal
> He was not very often on time

Committal
> He usually came late

The word _not_ is misused as a means of evasion, it should be used for denial or in antithesis. For example;

"not honest" -> "dishonest"
"did not pay attention" -> "ignored" 

Placing negatives and positives together creates stronger sentence structure;

> Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more

Preserving sentences with auxiliaries _would_, _should_, _could_ and _can_ for situations involving real uncertainty allows for your writing to assert authority. 

## Using Concrete Language

Prefer specific to general; 

General
> A period of unfavourable weather set in

Specific
> It rained every day for a week

Being specific engages the reader. 

## Omit Needless Words

Self explanitory, make every word earn its place

"the question as to whether" -> "whether"
"there is no doubt that" -> "no doubt"

"The fact that" is especially bad as it can always be replaced

"the fact that he had not succeeded" -> "his failure" 

>"His cousin, who is a member of the same firm" -> "His cousin, a member of the same firm" 

>"Trafalgar, which was Nelson's last battle" -> "Trafalgar, Nelson's last battle"

A common cause of wordiness is to present a single idea in a series of sentences rather than one.

## Avoid a succession of loose sentences

Sentences of two clauses, the second introduced by a conjunction or relative are to be avoided. A writer may include them to provide occasional relief however. 

Frequent loose sentences can lead to monotony. 

## Express Coordinate Ideas in Similar Form

A common mistake by unskilled writers is to put the value in varying form; this adds uncertainty to the writers point. A skilled writer's use similar form to add authority to a point.

This rule applies to articles and prepositions as well;

"the French, the Italians, Spanish and Portuguese" -> "the French, the Italians, the Spanish and the Portuguese" 

All appropriate prepositions must be included when such words are joined in a sentance.

## Keep related words together

Word position should show their relationship;

Separated
> He noticed a large stain in the rug that was right in the center

Together
> He noticed a large stain right in the centre of the rug

The reader has no idea whether the stain was in the centre of the rug or the rug in the centre of the room. 

The subject and principal verb should not be separated by a phrase or clause tha can be transferred to the beginning

"A dog, if you fail to discipline him, becomes a household pest" -> "Unless disciplined, a dog becomes a household pest"

## Summaries

Keep to one tense, minimize their usage; if needed keep it to one or two sentences. The writer should aim at writing a discussion supported by evidence, not ta summary with occasional comment.  

## Place important words at the end of sentence

The writer should place the most important words or group of words at then end of the sentence. 

"This steel is principally used for making razors, because of its hardness." -> "Because of its hardness, this steel is used principally for making razors." 

The other prominent position in the sentence is at the beginning; "Deceit or treachery she could never forgive."

However the impact of placing the subject at the start can be due to the meaning behind a word, a more mundane subject benefits from being at the end; 

"Through the middle of the valley flowed a winding stream" 

The principle of proper place for what is made prominent applies to sentences, paragraphs and a composition of paragraphs.
