# IoT Case Study in Air Pollution 

## Motivation

WHO head warned "Simple act of breathing is killing 7 million people a year and harming billions more" 

"Toxic air will shorten children lives by 12 months" 

## How do we absorb pollution in?

Particulate exposure - contact of airborne particulates with the human

Particulate dose - amount of particulates inhaled

Breathing faster and deeper results in greater does of particulates over the same period and level of exposure

## How do we measure them?

We can use a series of specks on people, and stationary points, we can use IoT to network all of these. 

Rather than measuring only stationary points, we can measure it where it matter - on people.

We also can monitor physiological response.

To preserve battery, we can only turn on for 10% of the day periodically.
