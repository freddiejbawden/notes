# Principles and Design of Internet Of Things Systems

## A Brief History of IoT

The original vision of IoT system was to provide a link between a virtual and digital worlds. We want to create systems that give people more information about the physical world using the benefits of a virtual system. 

The internet was about to explode with the introduction of IPv6, this means that we can have trillions of sub networks each with millions of nodes. 

It was proposed that we could have millions of miniature programmable semiconductor devices that can sense, compute and network wirelessly. 

We could use these computation "specks" to sense the environment, process the data and send it to a more powerful unit to finish the job. This means we can have widely distributed networks of sensors.
