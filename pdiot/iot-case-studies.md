## Laparoscopic Simulator

A Laparoscopy is a low risk, minimally invasive procedure that requires only small incisions.

We use inertial sensors attached to instruments to provide feedback on performance on a standard set of surgical skills.

We can analyse the measurements from the sensors against cohort of professionals. 

To develop this, we could try different placements of the sensors, for example on the tools or on the hand. Placement on the tools has concerns with size (surgical tools are very small), hands would be less accurate.
