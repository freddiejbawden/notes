# Environmental Sensing

One traditional application for IoT systems is to monitor environmental data over time.

These can involve using a variety of sensors such as temperature, moisture and particle to generate spatial and temporal data. 
## Sensors

### Temperature Sensors

There are two main types of temperature sensor


#### Thermocouple

These use two dissimilar metals to measure the temperature of the enviroment. The Seebeck effect between the metals creates a voltage difference as temperature varies that can be measured and converted. 

These can measure temperatures from -200 to 300 000 degrees and are normally used in industrial settings such as smeltries. 

####  Thermistor

These use the variation of resistance in an element as temperature. This  varies  the current in the element which can be read. 

### Hygrometer

Hygrometers measure humidity and water vapour in the atmosphere. This is normally measured through a relative humidity (rH).


#### Capacitive

These are low cost, low accuracy sensors that use  the effect of humidity on a  material within the sensor. 

##### Resistive

These measure the change in resistance due to fluctuations in humidity. 

#### Thermal

These use the thermal conductivity of the air to measure the moisture

#### Gravimetric

These use the mass of the air vs a ground truth to measure the amount of liquid in the air.

### Particle Sensor

These use a laser to detect shadows cast be particles passing through them.
