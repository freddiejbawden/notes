# IoT Case Study: Monitoring Respiority Issues In Patients

COPD is has proven difficult for many people to report on as the problem can be difficult to quanitfy. The symtoms include:

* Increase in breathlessness
* Changes in respiratory rate and breathing pattern
* Reduction in activity

Respriation can be monitored as a vital sign in catching COPD early.

The monitoring service needed to: 

* Produce daily reports summarising hourly trends
* Option to access historical data
* Resporitory rate, effort and flow activity
* Remote examination of the patient s breathing
* Prediction of exacerbation

To design this system, a focus group was used to gather requirements for the system. The system needed to be:
* Comfertable for long term wear (6 months)
* Easy to use
* No manual intervention needed

A system was designed that had a wireless, network capable respiration monitor that was mounted to a patients chest. Using data collected a ML model was trained to identify signs of exacerbation and notify nurses. 

A similar technology could also be used to help patients perform breathing exercises and to monitor the impact of the enviroment on the respiration system by mounting a GPS as well.
