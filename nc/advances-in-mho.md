## DNA Computing 

DNA can encode complex machines in the form of amino acids and protiens from very simplistic bases.

As DNA can split and branch, we can exploit it as a programmable matter to do computations as determined by material properties.

We can use this to pattern match cancerous cells for example and apply treatment at an extremely fine level. 

Another draw to DNA is the energy consumption and information density. 5 grams of DNA could store the internet ~100 times. It also is 1e9 times more energy sacrifice than classical computers. 

However we do have to sacrifice speed as a result. 

Our basic operations in DNA computing can be to cut, link and copy strands.
