# Physics Based Algorithms

Physics is a good source for MHOs, as it often solves complex optimization problems - orbital balance etc. This is known as the principle of least action, 

## Electromagentism-like optimisation (EMO)

Similar to PSO, however we use the attraction and repulsion between particles modelled off of electromagnetic forces

## Spiral Based Search

We spiral towards our local optimum, this provides good coverage around an optimum rather than b-lining to the optimum in PSO.
