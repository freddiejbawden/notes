## Meta-heuristics 

A typical case for metaheursitics is due to costly fitness evaluations; i.e. when a good solution is found with few fitness evaluations

### When should you use metaheursitics

MHO algorithms are also “models”, but their properties are often obscure. 

You should use MHO algorithms when:

* There is no exact or efficient algorithm available
* In discontinuous, nonlinear, ill-conditioned data (i.e. where gradients do not work in practice)
* Optimisation by simulation
* Support of exact methods or as meta-optimiser

I have no idea what this lecture was about.
